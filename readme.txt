TMEAV - The Magic Email Address Validator

This project has been written to play around with Python and Flask.
All features requested by my wife ;)

TMEAV provides a form to validate a single email address. It is also possible, to upload an XML containing several email addresses.
In addition, TMEAV can extract all valid email addresses from an XML file an split them to chunks of different sizes.

To start the development server, open a shell and type:
source run.sh

To run the magic email validator, open a browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:5000/
